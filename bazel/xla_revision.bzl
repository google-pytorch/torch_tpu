"""Holds the XLA commit and sha for easy automated updating."""

# To update XLA to a new revision,
# a) update XLA_COMMIT to the new git commit hash. Using JAX's XLA commit
#    is a good reference point.
# b) get the sha256 hash of the commit by running:
#    curl -L https://github.com/openxla/xla/archive/{git_hash}.tar.gz | sha256sum
#    and update XLA_SHA256 with the result.

XLA_COMMIT = "6c9d76d776efd5d700845c3f36da28adbb8cd846"
XLA_SHA256 = "97e1565ca1ba7f1a39bc530bf752e8f478b45c2621216a9253f19836bb57e2f7"
